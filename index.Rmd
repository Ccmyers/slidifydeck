## Introducing my first Shiny App

Started with the cool tabbed panels shiny app from

http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson1/

    runExample("06_tabsets") # tabbed panels

Then added:

1. interactive caption
2. mean and median calculated for the distibution
3. colored plot lines for mean and median on the histogram 
4. Adding text for mean and median values on the histogram

## Shiny any deployed on Shinyapps.io

Hosting shiny app here

https://ccmyers.shinyapps.io/myap/

Next slide is the partially working Shiny app in Slidifiy

Could not get Shiny slider input, main panel, or plots to work (yet) in Slidify 

Changed sliderinput to textinput as a temp fix

Only reactive part working is the text caption

(also tried to get my shiny ap working in R presentation but no success there either)

## Partially working Shiny app


```{r opts.label = 'shiny',cache=FALSE}

library(rmarkdown);library(shiny);sessionInfo();

  # and number of observations to generate. Note the use of the

## Summary

Shiny apps are pretty cool, and easy to update given the examples and tutorials!

Slidify looks promising, but needs more time before I can learn how to get all shiny widgets working.

Noticed that sometimes only Google Chrome displayed presentation correctly instead of Internet Explorer

Or I may have to learn html :-)

Or next time do a more simple shiny ap for my presentation example ??
